[B]OneBag3[/B] is part of a long line of bag replacements for the default game bags that will combine all of your bags into one frame.

OneBag has a long history of minimalism and OneBag3 will continue to uphold the standard of easy of use and simplicity it's predecessors set.  Like the earlier versions, OneBag3 will continue to offer powerful options for those who wish to delve a little deeper.

Also in the vein of earlier iterations I've kept to the philosophy of doing as little work as possible, as a result the code base is very small, and most of it is in the OneCore library.  As of the time of writing there are only 268 lines of code unique to OneBag3, and only 1804 lines of code in OneCore itself.  LoC is a horrible stat in general, but it's fun none the less, and I cheat horribly since I build off the powerful [URL="http://www.wowace.com/projects/Ace3"]Ace3 libraries[/URL].
