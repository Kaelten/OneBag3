**OneBag3** is part of a long line of bag replacements for the default game bags that will combine all of your bags into one frame.

OneBag has a long history of minimalism and OneBag3 will continue to uphold the standard of easy of use and simplicity it's predecessors set.  Like the earlier versions, OneBag3 will continue to offer powerful options for those who wish to delve a little deeper.

Also in the vein of earlier iterations I've kept to the philosophy of doing as little work as possible, as a result the code base is very small, and most of it is in the OneCore library.  As of the time of writing there are only 268 lines of code unique to OneBag3, and only 1804 lines of code in OneCore itself.  LoC is a horrible stat in general, but it's fun none the less, and I cheat horribly since I build off the powerful [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/Ace3|Ace3 libraries]].

===Search Syntax

Search inside of OneBag3 is powered by the [[https://github.com/Jaliborc/LibItemSearch-1.2|LibItemSearch library by Jalibroc]].  As a result it supports many advanced search options.

**Search Operators**

* **Logical NOT**: "!q:epic" matches items that are NOT epic.
* **Logical OR**: "q:epic | q:rare" matches items that are either epic OR rare.
* **Logical AND**: "q:epic & t:weapon" matches items that are epic AND weapons.
* **Greater Than**: "lvl: > 30" matches items that are higher than level 30.
* **Less Than**: "lvl: < 30" matches items that are less than level 30.
* **Greater or Equal to**: "lvl: => 30" matches items that are lvl 30 or greater.
